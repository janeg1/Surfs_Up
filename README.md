# Surfs_Up Analysis

## Overview.
We were presented with sqlite file, that had info on 2 tables, Measurments and Station.Those had varios info like station id, name, location, temperatures, amount of precepitation in Hawaii. With this info we need to help a client to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

### Results.
We analized the weather for June and December and we can determine that average weather is:
*max temps are almost the same (June 85', Dec 83'),
*min temps slightly different (June 64', Dec 56'),
*mean temps (June 75', Dec 71').

## Conclusion.
Weather in Hawaii stays pretty much the same, so there will be no decline in business to run it year round.

### Additional info.
We can also run two additional queries and determine which month has the most percepitation and which month is the coldest, which can help the shop owner to decide if they want to take time off during those months as they will be the slowest for business.
